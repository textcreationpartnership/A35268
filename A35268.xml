            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HER GRACE, THE Dutcheſs of Albemarle.</head>

               <hi>POETRY ſeem's on Earth, Madam, in the condition of the Philoſopher's Muſick in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, placed in a vast, Solitude where there is nothing to hear it but ſome few</hi> Angels <hi>that move thoſe Heavens.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The Earth wants no Inhabitants; but whilſt thoſe Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants want ſence 'tis as ſolitary as the Heavens; and a Poet ſings like a Bird in the Deſert. Yet there are ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Excellent Spirits below, and in the firſt Rank of 'em is your</hi> Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Angels are, we know not; but when we wou'd make 'em viſible to our thoughts, we dreſs e'm up in ſuch Qualities as Nature and Fortune have beſtowed on your</hi> Grace; <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Wiſdom, <hi>great</hi> Power, <hi>boundleſs</hi> Generoſity, <hi>and profound</hi> Humility; <hi>and they, to requite our good thoughts of 'em, when they make themſelves viſible to our

            <p>
               <hi>And in this,</hi> Madam, <hi>I do not flatter you, but my ſelf; I do not</hi> advance <hi>you above what you are, but I</hi> raiſe <hi>my ſelf among thoſe who were honoured to be</hi> the Entertainers of Angels, <hi>but with this difference: They knew not their</hi> Gueſts, <hi>and ſo were to be pardoned their</hi> Unleavened Bread, <hi>and their</hi> fatted Calves; <hi>elſe a</hi> fooliſh Beaſt <hi>had been an</hi> abſurd Treat <hi>for a</hi> Creature, <hi>who was all</hi> Mind, <hi>and that</hi> Mind <hi>all</hi> Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But all the World knows your</hi> Graces delicate Spirit, <hi>and therefore my</hi> Hoſpitality <hi>becomes my</hi> Crime. <hi>I ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your</hi> Grace <hi>unpleaſant</hi> Fruit, <hi>that</hi> bloſſom'd <hi>in a</hi> Stormy <hi>time, and ſo had much ado to</hi> grow, <hi>and never cou'd be</hi> Ripe.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Play, which I think the moſt Vigorous, of all my fooliſh Labours, was born in a time ſo unhealthy to Poetry, that I dare not venture it abroad without as many Cloaths as I can give it to keep it warm. Let this excuſe then ſerve to cover ſome of the nakedneſſes and deformities of it, that they are not ſo much mine as the Faults of the troubleſome times. I alwayes expected to be aſſaulted by Enemies, but I did not expect they ſhould drop out of the Clouds. I had heaped together all the Fancy I had to place my ſelf out of the reach of my Enemies, but as I was building my <hi>Babel,</hi> thoſe things which diſordered greater matters than theſe, confounded my Language, and made me give over my work, that in the end of the Play, you will find me deſcended into the Plains, and layn down weary and fainting. But where I ſhew leaſt wit, I ſhew

moſt wiſdom, for there I take my eaſe, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where I take pains to none, or very little purpoſe. To pleaſe Friends is hard, to pleaſe my Self more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, but to pleaſe my Enemies impoſſible. How fooliſh then is my toyl?

               <hi>Fools</hi> damn good Playes, and <hi>Fortune</hi> good Poets.

Much is loſt by Poetry; Time, Pains, and often Friends: Nothing is gotten but a little Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that ſome envious Enemies of ours will rather fling to the Doggs than let us have it, witneſs the ſilly malice of ſome Adverſar<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To thoſe who perhaps thinking themſelves wiſer than others, will not accept of my excuſe of Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſcouragement; for the inequalities of the

Play, but aſcribe 'em to my want of Judgement; I ſhall only ſay, ſuppoſing their Charge were true, I know no Poet, that like a Bird of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> lives all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the Air and never lights, or if he does, he muſt ſleep there ſometimes. Did a man take Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to write in; though there be perfection in Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is none in Man; and he wou'd be giddy and fall in going that vaſt round, eſpecially if he always look'd upwards.</p>
